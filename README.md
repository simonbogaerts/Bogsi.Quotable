# What is Quotable?

A massively, overengineered, best practise filled solution using dotnet. It's a CRUD interface for quotes and their respectable origins, nothing more, nothing less. 

It's an experiment where I take a deep dive in some best practices regarding dotnet and REST. Further delve into Docker and Docker Compose. Set-up an entire environment using development containers, and test my code base using test containers. 

Afterwards I'll be using Quotable when trying new frontend frameworks, cloud platforms, or other stuff that might need a teeny tiny application laying around to test. 


# Prerequisites

* Docker
* WSL2+


# How to run Quotable

Simply use the following command in the terminal (when in the main project folder):

```
docker compose up -d
```


To stop Quotable use the following docker command.

```
docker compose down
```

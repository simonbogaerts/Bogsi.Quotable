# Quotable by BOGsi

_adjective._ 
	suitable for or worthÂ quoting.


## What is Quotable?

A massively, over-engineered, best-practice-filled-solution using dotnet. It's a CRUD interface for quotes and their respectable origins, nothing more, nothing less. 

It's an experiment where I take a deep dive in some best practices regarding dotnet and REST. Further delve into Docker and Docker Compose. Set-up an entire environment using development containers, and test my code base using test containers. 

Afterwards I'll be using Quotable when trying new frontend frameworks, cloud platforms, or other stuff that might need a teeny tiny application laying around to test. 


## Prerequisites

* Docker
* WSL2+


## How to run Quotable

Simply use the following command in the terminal (when in the main project folder):

```
docker compose up -d
```


To stop Quotable use the following docker command.

```
docker compose down
```

## Code Quality

StyleCope file added to solution items folder and linked to other folders as Link.
All StyleCop and SonarAnalyzer rules are followed except for the following: 

* SA1009: Closing parenthesis should be spaced correctly
* SA1101: Prefix local calls with this
* SA1124: Do not use regions
* SA1313: Parameter names should begin with lower-case letter
* SA1309: Field names should not begin with underscore
* CA1815: Override equals and operator equals on value types
* CA1040: Avoid empty interfaces
    * required for marker interface.
* CA1034: Nested types should not be visible
* CA1031: Do not catch general exception types


## Roadmap

* add documentation
* code quality with static analyzers.
* code quality with sonarqube.


* Cashing with Redis (use Valkey instead = redis no longer open source, devs moved over to valkey)
* head and options endpoints 
* concurrency 
* Add additional pocos like author and tags
* Add indexes 
* Add security to everything



## Considerations

* Add service between repo and handler. make repo use entities and service use models?
* fix creates dates on create return object 
* fluentassertion because args not doing what they supposed to do. 
    * see GivenGetAsync_WhenPaginationIsProvidedAndIsDefault_ThenReturnCorrectCollectionAndCursorInfo for correct useage.

=> use this for some docker stuff maybe? 


## Additional

* **Health checks**. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4abSfjdzqms
* **Cursor pagination vs SkipTake Pagination**. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfRJBoOuNUA
* I chose to unit test my mappers because without them I wouldn't know about the resolver (since you can only have a single FromMember for a member).
* I chose to use resolver instead of inline mapping because this makes the profile easier to read and profile doesn't need to know the specific of the resolve.
